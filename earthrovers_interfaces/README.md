# earthrovers_interfaces
Package containing custom service and message types for interacting with the

Custom service types created according to this official ROS2 Humble tutorial:
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Custom-ROS2-Interfaces.html.
Follow that tutorial for adding additional messages and services.
